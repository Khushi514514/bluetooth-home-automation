Bluetooth Home Automation using Tinkercad + MIT App Inventor

This is an **online simulation project** where appliances (like bulbs or LEDs) are controlled using:
- Push buttons (as physical switches)
- A mobile app via Bluetooth connection

This is a combination of **Tinkercad circuit simulation** and **MIT App Inventor app development**, made without any physical hardware.

 Features

- Control 4 devices using push buttons
- Control same 4 devices from mobile app using Bluetooth
- Arduino-based simulation built in **Tinkercad**
- App built using **MIT App Inventor**
- Smart switching with relay logic

Components Used (Virtually)

- Arduino UNO
- Push buttons
- 4 LEDs (acting as lights or appliances)
- Bluetooth module (HC-05 simulated)
- MIT App Inventor app

 How it Works

1. Upload Arduino code in Tinkercad
2. Use push buttons to toggle each appliance
3. Connect your mobile app to Bluetooth
4. Control the same appliances from your phone

 How to Run the Project

1. Open [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
2. Import the `.ino` code and build the same circuit
3. Use MIT App Inventor to import the `.aia` file
4. Install app on phone using MIT AI2 Companion
5. Connect via Bluetooth and control devices
